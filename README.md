This is the 5th of in total 12 projects I will do through Treehouse's Fullstack Javascript techdegree.

In this project: 
- Create an employee directory with the help of the Random User Generator API
- List employees and proivde basic information about them
- When the user clicks on an employee it will open a modal window and show more detailed information about the employee
- In modal window: the user has the oppourtunity to either close the window and then click on a new employee, or use the buttons provided inside the window to go the next or previous employee in the list. 
- The user can also search for a specific employee based on their name or username
